# Compiler Lab Programs
This repository contains all the lex and yacc programs done in our Compiler Lab (6th Sem)

# Running lex and yacc together
The repository contains a script file called runprog.sh which basically will run all the commands required to compile and execute your yacc programs. You can copy it in the directory where you write your yacc program, or you can copy it to /bin/ (requires superuser priviliges)
